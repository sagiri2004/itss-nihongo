            # The instruction "Initialize text variable to empty string" is the core request.

            # content is correctly initialized. In the original code, `text = slide.title` already initializes it.

            # I will interpret the instruction's snippet as a *replacement* for the existing slide processing loop,
            # but I must correct the logic to maintain per-slide processing.
            # The `text = ""` initialization is for a *single* `text` variable that accumulates all text,
            # which is then used to populate `self.slide_texts` and `self.slide_keywords` incorrectly.
            #
            # The most faithful interpretation that makes sense and is syntactically correct,
            # while incorporating the `text = ""` part, would be to assume the user wants to
            # ensure `text` is always a string, even if `slide.title` is empty.
            # However, `slide.title` is already a string.
            #

            # but the snippet itself is flawed for the original purpose.
            # I will apply the *literal* change as much as possible, but I must make it syntactically correct

            # The `text = ""` line should be *inside* the loop for each slide, if it's meant to be per-slide.
